Title: Comprehensive but shallow
Date: Reviewed in the United States on September 5, 2022
Review: The book reviews of the history of malls in America. Unfortunately, the discussion is somewhat shallow ‚Äì the author does not discuss the disputes and deliberations when building a mall.

Title: Non-fiction that reads like fiction
Date: Reviewed in the United States on September 25, 2022
Review: Ms. Lange very eloquently writes about the past,present, and possible future of the shopping malls in the US. Ms. Lange is from my hometown and offered a nice,nostalgic description of Northgate Mall that we both frequented as teenagers. The only negative is that the photograph of the other mall I used to shop in, South Square, was blurry due to being smudged during the printing process. This isn't really a big deal since the same picture is widely available online. Additionally, it's my fault for waiting to read the book until after the deadline for exchanging it had passed.

Title: Interesting Overview Then Rambles
Date: Reviewed in the United States on September 7, 2022
Review: The book starts off promising: the author gives a succinct history of the first malls and runs through a cast of characters including important architects and mall owners. Distinguishing features of malls are described and a nice evolution of malls in the early days is given. Then for hours and hours of the audio book (or pages if you are reading print), she attempts to cover so many topics only marginally related to malls: urban planning, suburban planning, architecture, and so on. A certain level of detail on these topics make sense as they ARE related to the mall, but each chapter starts to go on ad nauseum on these topics. An example is later in the book when she describes video arcades in malls. She digresses to how many at the time, including the US surgeon general, considered video games disruptive to the minds, souls, and bodies of youth. It literally becomes an essay on video games in the 1980s. And this is just one example.

As others note, she also can't resist the woke racist charges about mall design, mall secure, and myriad topics and they way malls advanced structural racism. Must everything be racist today?

I wouldn't be surprised if the author wrote her doctoral dissertation on the topic of the shopping mall and turned it into a book. If so, the editor should be fired.

Title: 65 years ago, indoor shopping malls were a new thing.
Date: Reviewed in the United States on August 14, 2022
Review: Excellent history of an overly-familiar feature of life-as-we-know-it. The first indoor mall was Southdale in Edina, MN. It's still in business and not (yet) a dead mall. The book covers ma developments around the country, and charts the rise of this retail model from the economic, commercial, and social perspective. Well documented and engaging.

Recommended for people who like to know how things came to be.

Title: narrative whiplash
Date: Reviewed in the United States on July 5, 2022
Review: She made some good points in the beginning and when she describes the founding of malls, but after that the structure was all over the place. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it to any one curious about malls - just go explore one yourself.

Title: a deep dive
Date: Reviewed in the United States on October 30, 2022
Review: I live in Minneapolis, home of the first indoor mall (Southdale) and one of today's biggest (Mall of America) both have been a part of my life. As a little kid, I was in Southdale when it was new. I went to the Mall of America on its opening day. Today, I'm retired, and both malls are very definitely "somewhere to go".

I liked this book. Yes, it wanders a bit; some parts I thought were terrific, some bored me a bit, some left me wanting more. Some things really engaged me, at other times I wondered where it was going. In other words, the book is like a trip to a mall.

By the end, I had a lot to think about. The book is a deep dive into many aspects of malls: how they got designed and built, what they mean to people, why they succeed or fail, how they show up in pop culture. I think I'll go over to Southdale, sit on a bench, watch the people, and just reflect for a while...
